LockedIN Keyboard

Locked In Keyboard was created to help people with Locked In Syndrome communicate with just their eyes. In order to do this, I analyzed 1200 images in PyTorch and YOLO to create a model that can predict the gaze of your pupils. The website consists of a keyboard created using css and javascript. Then the website uses the user's webcam to predict which key the user is looking at.
