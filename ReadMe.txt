LockedIN Keyboard

Locked In Keyboard was created to help people with Locked In Syndrome communicate with just their eyes. In order to do this over 800 images we analysed in PyTorch to create a model that can predict the gaze of your pupils. The website consists of a keyboard created using css and javascript. Then the website uses the user's webcam to predict which key the user is looking at.
